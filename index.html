            <p>Generative text-to-image models (as exemplified by DALL-E, MidJourney, and Stable Diffusion) have recently made enormous
technological leaps, demonstrating impressive results in many graphical domainsâ€”from logo design to digital painting and
photographic composition. However, the quality of these results has led to existential crises in some fields of art, leading to questions
about the role of human agency in the production of meaning in a graphical context. Such issues are central to visualization, and
while these generative models have yet to be widely applied to visualization, it seems only a matter of time until their integration is
manifest. Seeking to circumvent similar ponderous dilemmas, we attempt to understand the roles that generative models might play
across visualization. </p>
